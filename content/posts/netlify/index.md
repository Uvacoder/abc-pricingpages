#  Build, deploy, and manage modern web projects
An all-in-one workflow that combines global deployment, continuous integration, and automatic HTTPS. And that’s just the beginning.

## Deploy your site in seconds*

Connect your repository. Add your build settings. Deploy your website
*Nope, no gotcha here. It just takes a few clicks.*

## Go beyond static

### Nail the fundamentals with rock-solid deployment
Deploy to a redundant network of servers with built‑in continuous integration and HTTPS.

### Add dynamic functionality with built‑in applications
Manage user identity, HTML forms, and even AWS Lambda functions with ease.

### Customize your projects with your own build tools or microservices
Use your favorite tools for search, payments, commenting, or content management.

## There’s a better way to deploy web projects

### A single, simplified workflow
Get all the tools you need to deploy and manage your site. Replace your hosting infrastructure, continuous integration, and deployment pipeline with a single workflow.

### Performance from the ground up
Run your site on a purpose-built, multi-cloud infrastructure that’s designed for speed, automated to scale, and intrinsically secure.

### Don’t stop at static
Netlify’s tool-agnostic platform helps you go dynamic on your own terms: choose from built-in add ons, integrate a favorite tool, or roll your own.
