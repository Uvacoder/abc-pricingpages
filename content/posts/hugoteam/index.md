# Connected Meeting Notes.

Centralized, searchable meeting notes that connect with your favorite tools.

## Meetings should drive action, not disappear into docs

**When too many meetings are a waste of time**
Hours of discussion, and yet only a fraction of things get decided, assigned, and done ...
**You try keeping scattered notes and recording calls**
But you end up with isolated docs and gigs of audio that no one else can find ...
**Collaboration should be easy, but instead you're always copying**
â€” and pasting notes and tasks into emails, chat, your CRM and project tools ...

Hugo is the only note-taking app designed to optimize hectic meeting workflows

## Hugo connects the way you meet to the way you work

**Unite your meeting notes with the tools you use most**
With #tagging, @mentions, and 20+ integrations, instantly sync info and create tasks from any meeting note.
**Make sure everyone shows up prepared**
Agenda templates and timely reminders help ensure all meetings are set up for success.
**Searchable meeting notes based on your calendar**
Hugo automatically indexes your notes by the people and companies at every meeting.
