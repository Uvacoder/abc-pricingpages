# The game of SaaS is afoot! Are you ready to start winning?

Excellent! Sherlock gives your entire organization access to the vital product engagement data needed to grow revenue. And we’re not talking about that static, last active stuff. This is real engagement scoring. For your real SaaS business. (You are a real SaaS business, aren’t you?)

## Score customers using product engagement metrics
Sherlock simplifies your complex product data into 3 easy to understand metrics, then uses them to score each of your customers
* **Activation** Conditions prospects match to become an active customer
* **Engagement** Number of times & frequency customers use key features
* **Adoption** Percentage of key features used by customers

## Understand users and accounts at a glance
Easily tell whether a customer is activated, engaged, or have adopted your features

## Get a bird’s eye view on your users and accounts
Create segments of your best and worst customers and rank them by activation, engagement, adoption, active users, and more. Get clarity on who needs help, and who is ready to expand.

## Push scores to the tools you’re already using
Leverage Sherlock scores in your existing tools to power your team’s sales and support efforts. Convert activated prospects, expand engaged customers, or educate slow adopters — using the workflow your team is already familiar with.
