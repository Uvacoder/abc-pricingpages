# Put your creative energy to work, with Dropbox

Dropbox is a modern workspace designed to reduce busywork—so you can focus on the things that matter.

## Keep everything organized without breaking your flow
Dropbox brings your files together, in one central place. They’re easy to find and safely synced across all your devices—so you can access them anytime, anywhere. No more wasting the day tracking down work.

## Collaborate on presentations, designs, and any kind of file

Dropbox is built for creative collaboration. Share a big file—PowerPoint, Photoshop, Sketch—with anyone. You’ve all got the right version, and everybody’s on the same page. Finally.

## Create without chaos on Dropbox Paper

Paper is your team’s place to bring ideas to life. Brainstorm, collect inspiration, share rough drafts. Paper can hold everything from video and images, to code and sound.
