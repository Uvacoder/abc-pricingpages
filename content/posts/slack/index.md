# Imagine what youâ€™ll accomplish together
Slack is a collaboration hub for work, no matter what work you do. Itâ€™s a place where conversations happen, decisions are made, and information is always at your fingertips. With Slack, your team is better connected.

## Your hub for teamwork

Project discussions, important documents, free food announcements: they all live tidily together in Slack. With your team and information in one easily searchable place, collaborating online is as easy as collaborating in person.

### Channels
Communication in Slack happens in channels, organized by project, topic, team, or whatever makes sense for you.

### Search
Conversations in Slack are searchable by everyone, so you can tap into company knowledge and find information when you need it.

### Integrations
Slack works with the tools and services you already use every day. Pipe in information or take action without leaving Slack.

### Security
We take security seriously at Slack. We offer measures like 2FA and SSO to ensure the safety of your data and protect your organization.
